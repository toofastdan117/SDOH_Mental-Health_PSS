The category "with a broadband Internet subscription" refers to those who said "Yes" to at least one of the following types of Internet subscriptions: Broadband such as cable, fiber optic, or DSL; a cellular data plan; satellite; a fixed wireless subscription; or other non-dial up subscription types.<br/><br/>

Methodological changes to citizenship edits may have affected citizenship data for those born in American Samoa. Users should be aware of these changes when using 2018 data or multi-year data containing data from 2018. For more information, see: <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2019-01.html">American Samoa Citizenship User Note.</a><br/><br/>

Supporting documentation on code lists, subject definitions, data accuracy, and statistical testing can be found on the American Community Survey website in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html">Technical Documentation</a> section.<br /><br />Sample size and data quality measures (including coverage rates, allocation rates, and response rates) can be found on the American Community Survey website in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality/">Methodology</a> section.<br/><br/>

An Internet "subscription" refers to a type of service that someone pays for to access the Internet such as a cellular data plan, broadband such as cable, fiber optic or DSL, or other type of service. This will normally refer to a service that someone is billed for directly for Internet alone or sometimes as part of a bundle.<br/><br/>

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.<br/><br/>

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html">ACS Technical Documentation</a>). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.<br/><br/>

The "children of the householder" and "own children of the householder" concepts are combined in these estimates. For more information, please the following User Note <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2022-02.html"> .<br/><br/>

Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2010 data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.<br/><br/>

Explanation of Symbols:<TABLE><TR><TD>-</TD><TD> The estimate could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations. For a ratio of medians estimate, one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an open-ended distribution.

Ancestry listed in this table refers to the total number of people who responded with a particular ancestry; for example, the estimate given for Russian represents the number of people who listed Russian as either their first or second ancestry. This table lists only the largest ancestry groups; see the Detailed Tables for more categories. Race and Hispanic origin groups are not included in this table because official data for those groups come from the Race and Hispanic origin questions rather than the ancestry question (see Demographic Table).<br/><br/>

Data for year of entry of the native population reflect the year of entry into the U.S. by people who were born in Puerto Rico or U.S. Island Areas or born outside the U.S. to a U.S. citizen parent and who subsequently moved to the U.S.<br/><br/>

With a computer includes those who said "Yes" to at least one of the following types of computers: Desktop or laptop; smartphone; tablet or other portable wireless computer; or some other type of computer.<br/><br/>

Data about computer and Internet use were collected by asking respondents to select "Yes" or "No" to each type of computer and each type of Internet subscription. Therefore, respondents were able to select more than one type of computer and more than one type of Internet subscription.<br/><br/>

The Census Bureau introduced a new set of disability questions in the 2008 ACS questionnaire. Accordingly, comparisons of disability data from 2008 or later with data from prior years are not recommended. For more information on these questions and their evaluation in the 2006 ACS Content Test, see the <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2007/acs/2007_Brault_01.pdf">Evaluation Report Covering Disability</a>.<br/><br/>

The 2017-2021 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the March 2020 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. In certain instances, the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB delineation lists due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.<br/><br/>
